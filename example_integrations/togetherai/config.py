Your task is to analyze the conversation and determine if the issue should be escalated to a human agent.

ESCALATION CRITERIA:
- Customer has expressed frustration multiple times
- Issue remains unresolved after 3+ attempts
- Customer explicitly requests human assistance

- MEDIUM: Some difficulty but progress being made
- HIGH: Clear escalation needed - frustrated customer or complex issue

Assess the conversation objectively and provide escalation recommendations.
